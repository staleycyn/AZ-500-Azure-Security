# Lab 01 - Role-Based Access Control

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how Azure users and groups are created. Also, how role-based access control is used to assign roles to groups. Specifically, you need to:

- Create a Senior Admins group with member Joseph Price. 
- Create a Junior Admins group with member Isabel Garcia. 
- Create a Service Desk group with member Dylan Williams.  
- Assign the Service Desk group Virtual Machine Contributor permissions. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East (US)** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following:

- Exercise 1: Create the Senior Admins group with member Joseph Price (Portal). 
- Exercise 2: Create the Junior Admins group with member Isabel Garcia (PowerShell).
- Exercise 3: Create the Service Desk group with member Dylan Williams (CLI). 
- Exercise 4: Assign the Service Desk group Virtual Machine Contributor permissions.

## Exercise 1: Create the Senior Admins group with member Joseph Price. 

### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

1. Use the Portal menu and select **All services**. 

1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. On the **Overview blade** note your tenant domain. You will need this in later steps. This takes the form *xxx.onmicrosoft.com*.

1. Under **Manage** select **Users**, and then select **New user**.

1. On the **User** page, fill out the blade with the following information:

	- **User name**: Joseph
      
	- **Name**: Joseph Price

1. Click **Create**.

> Result: You used the Azure Portal to create a user and a group, and assigned the user to the group. 

## Exercise 2: Create the Junior Admins group with member Isabel Garcia.

### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will:

- Task 1: Use PowerShell to create a user account for Isabel Garcia.
- Task 2: Use PowerShell to create the Junior Admins group and assign Isabel to the group. 

#### Task 1: Use PowerShell to create a user account for Isabel Garcia.

In this task, you will create a user account for Isabel Garcia.

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

	> To copy and paste to the shell, right-click in the pane and **Paste as plain text**. 

	> Bookmark the [Azure PowerShell page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/?view=azps-4.1.0#resources). The Reference section provides commands grouped by category, like Active Directory and Virtual Machines. 

1. Create a password profile object.

    ```
    $PasswordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
    ```

1. Create a password.

    ```
    $PasswordProfile.Password = "Pa55w.rd"
    ```

1. Connect to Azure Active Directory. This is required when using PowerShell. 

    ```
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```
      
1. Create a user, Isabel Garcia. Substitute *yourdomain* with your domain. 

	```
    New-AzureADUser -DisplayName "Isabel Garcia" -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile   -UserPrincipalName "Isabel@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com" -AccountEnabled $true -MailNickName "Isabel" 
    ```

1. Notice the UserPrincipalName for Isabel. You will need this to add her to the Junior Admins group. 

1. Get a list of users. Both, Mark and Isabel, should be listed. 

	```
	Get-AzureADUser 
	```

### Task 2: Use PowerShell to create the Junior Admins group and assign Isabel to the group.

In this task, you will create the Junior Admins group and assign Isabel to the group. 

1. Continue in the Cloud Shell. 

1. Create a new security group named Junior Admins.
	
	```
	New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName "Junior Admins" -MailEnabled $false -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName JuniorAdmins
	```

1. Verify the group was created. You should now have two groups, Senior Admins and Junior Admins.  

    ```
    Get-AzureADGroup
    ```

1. Assign Isabel to the Junior Admins group. Use *yourdomain*. 
	
	```
	Add-AzADGroupMember -MemberUserPrincipalName "isabel@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com" -TargetGroupDisplayName "Junior Admins" 
	```

1. Check the Junior Admins group membership and ensure Isabel is a member.

	```
	Get-AzADGroupMember -GroupDisplayName "Junior Admins"
	```

> Result: You used PowerShell to create a user and a group, and assigned the user to the group. 


## Exercise 3: Create the Service Desk group with member Dylan Williams. 

### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will:

- Task 1: Use the CLI to create a user account for Dylan Williams.
- Task 2: Use the CLI to create the Service Desk group and assign Dylan to the group. 

#### Task 1: Use the CLI to create a user account for Dylan Williams.

> Bookmark the [CLI reference page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest). The Reference section has a command list with usage information. 

In this task, you will create a user account for Dylan Williams.. 

1. Continue in the Cloud Shell.

1. Use the top left drop-down to select **Bash** and then click **Confirm**.

1. Create a user, Dylan Williams. Use *yourdomain*.
 
      ```

      ```
      
1. Get a list of users. Joseph, Isabel, and Dylan should be listed. You will need Dylan's ObjectID to add him to the Service Desk group. 
	
      ```
      az ad user list --output table
      ```

#### Task 2: Use the CLI to create the Service Desk group and assign Dylan to the group. 

In this task, you will create the Service Desk group and assign Dylan to the group. 

1. Continue in the Cloud Shell.

1. Create a new security group named Service Desk.

   	```
	az ad group create --display-name "Service Desk" --mail-nickname ServiceDesk
   	```
 
1. Verify the Service Desk group was created. You should also have the Senior Admins and Junior Admins groups.  

   	```
	az ad group list -o table
	```

1. Assign Dylan to the Service Desk group. Use Dylan's ObjectID for Member-id. 

   	```
	az ad group member add --group "Service Desk" --member-id xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   	```

1. Check the Service Desk group membership and ensure Dylan is a member.
