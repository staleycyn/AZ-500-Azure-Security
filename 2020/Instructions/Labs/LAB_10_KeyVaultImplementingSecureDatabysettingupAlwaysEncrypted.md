# Lab 10 - Key Vault (Implementing Secure Data by setting up Always Encrypted)

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept application that makes use of Always encrypted in SQL. Secrets, keys, and certificates should be stored in the key vault. It would be nice if this was combined with some of the advantages in Azure app registration to improve the security posture of the application. Specifically, the proof of concept should include:

- Creating a key vault and storing keys and secrets in the vault.
- Create a SQL Database and encrypting column information using Always Encrypted.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete:

- Exercise 1: Configure the key vault with a key and a secret
- Exercise 2: Create an application to demonstrate using the key vault for encryption
 
## Exercise 1: Introduction to Azure Key Vault

### Estimated timing: xx minutes

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East (US)** region. Verify with your instructor this is region to use for you class. 

In this exercise, you will complete:

- Task 1: Download and install SQL Server Management Studio
- Task 2: Create and configure a key vault
- Task 3: Add a key to the key vault
- Task 4: Add a secret to the key vault

#### Task 1: Download and install SQL Server Management Studio

In this task, you will download and install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

1. Visit the [Download SQL Server Management Studio](**https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017) page.

2. Use the link to download the executable and then run the installer.  

	> You do not need to wait for the SQL Management Studio to install before continuing.

#### Task 2: Create and configure a Key Vault

In this task, you will create a lab resource group and a key vault. You will also configure the key vault permissions.

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

1. Open the Cloud Shell. 

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu.

1. Create a new resource group for the lab. 

    ```
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ500LAB10' -Location 'eastus'
    ```

1. Create a key vault in the resource group. The key vault name must be unique. Remember the name you have chosen. You will need it throughout this lab.  

    ```
    New-AzKeyVault -VaultName '<keyvault name>' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ500LAB10' -Location 'eastus'
    ```

	> The output of this shows important pieces of information: Vault Name and the Vault URI. The Vault URI takes the form: https://your_name.vault.azure.net/

1. Close the Cloud Shell. 

1. In the Azure Portal navigate to the **AZ500LAB10** Resource Group.

1. Select your key vault. 

1. Under **Settings** select **Access Policies** and then **+ Add Access Policy**.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu.

1. In the next steps, you will set the sqlApp key permissions. 

1. Create a variable for the Application (client) ID. You copied this information previously. 
   
    ```
    $applicationId = '[Azure_AD_Application_ID]'
	```

1. Create a variable for your key vault name.
	```
    $vaultName = '[KeyVault_Name]' 
    ```

1. Set the permissions. 

    ```
    Set-AZKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $vaultName -ResourceGroupName AZ500LAB10 -ServicePrincipalName $applicationId -PermissionsToKeys get,wrapKey,unwrapKey,sign,verify,list
    ```

#### Task 3: Create a SQL Database

In this task, you will create an empty SQL Database and determine the ADO.NET connection string. 


1. Continue in the Azure Portal.

1. When the encryption process is complete, click **Close**.

1. Expand **medical > security > Always Encrypted Keys**.

	> There are now Column Master Keys and Column Encryption Keys. 


George - is there another way to show this without a console app? Maybe we can just add a few records then do a query and how the data is encrypted?

#### Task x: Build a Console Application to work with Encrypted Columns

Then you will create a Console application using Visual Studio to load data into the encrypted columns and then access that data securely using a connection string that accesses the key in the Key Vault.

1. Open Visual Studio 2019.

1. Sign in using your Azure account.

1. Click **File > New > Project**

    > In the next step **DO NOT CHOOSE** **Console App (.NET Core)**  
 
1. Select **Visual C#** > Search for **Console App** > Choose **Console App (.NET Framework)** and provide the name **OpsEncrypt** in the location **C:\\** and then click **OK**.

1. **Right-Click** the **OpsEncrypt** project > click **Properties**.

1.  Change the **Target Framework** to **.NET Framework 4.7.2.** Click **Yes** when prompted to change the **Target Framework.**

1.  Install the following **NuGet** packages by going to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console.**

    ```
    Install-Package     Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider
    ```

    ```
    Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory
    ```

1.  Open the **program.cs** file in notepad from Allfiles\\Labs\\Mod1_Lab02 and copy the code.

1.  Replace the code in **Program.cs** in Visual Studio with the code you just copied.

1.  Locate the **Connection string, clientId, and clientSecret** settings in the Main method and replace them with the values that you copied from the previous steps.

1.  **Click** the **Start Button** in **Visual Studio**.


1.  **The Console Application** will **Build** and then start. First it will ask for your password, then the app will add data to the database.

    - Server Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1.  **Leave** the **Console Application Running** and move to the **SQL Management Studio**. Right-Click the medical database and click **New Query**.



1.  Run the following query to see the data that was loaded into the database is encrypted.

    ```
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, SSN, BirthDate FROM Patients;
    ```


1.  Now, move back to the console application where you will be asked to **Enter** a **Valid SSN**. This will query the encrypted column for the data. Notice that with the key called from the Key Vault, now the data is unencrypted and shown to the console window.

    ```
    999-99-0003
    ```

1.  To **Exit** you press enter.




**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. Access the Cloud Shell.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. Remove the resource group using the Cloud Shell and PowerShell.

    ```
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB10"
    ```
