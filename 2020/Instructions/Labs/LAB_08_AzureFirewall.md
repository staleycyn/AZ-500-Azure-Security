# Lab 08 - Azure Firewall

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to install Azure Firewall. This will help your organization control outbound network access which is an important part of an overall network security plan. Specifically, you would like to create and test this infrastructure. 

- A virtual network with a workload subnet and a jump subnet.
- A virtual machine is each subnet. 
- A custom route that ensures all outbound workload traffic from the workload subnet must use the firewall.
- Firewall Application rules that only allow outbound traffic to www.bing.com. 
- Firewall Network rules that allow access to DNS server lookups.

Lab files:

-  **2020\\Allfiles\\Labs\\LAB_08\\template.json**
