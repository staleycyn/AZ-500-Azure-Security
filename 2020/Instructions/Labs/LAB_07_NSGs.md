	- Name: **Allow-RDP-All**                                                                                                   

1. Click **Add** to deploy the new inbound rule. 

> Result: You have deployed a virtual network, network security with inbound security rules, and two application security groups. 

## Exercise 2: Deploy virtual machines and test network filters

### Exercise timing: 25 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete:

- Task 1: Create a virtual machine to use as a web server.
- Task 2: Create a virtual machine to use as a management server. 

#### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to use as a web server.

In this task, you will create a virtual machine to use as a web server.

1. On the Portal menu (top left) select **Create a resource**.

1. Under **Popular**, select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.

	- Region: **East US**

	- User: **localadmin**

	- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

	- Public Inbound ports: **None** - We will rely on our NSG rules. 

1. Move to the **Networking** tab (top) and verify this information. Take the default value for any setting that is not specified. 

	- Virtual network: **myVirtualNetwork**

	- NIC network security group: **None**

1. Move to the **Management** tab, and ensure **Boot diagnostics** is **Off**.

1. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

1. You do not need to wait for this virtual machine to deploy. Continue to the next task.

#### Task 2: Create a virtual machine to use as a management server. 

In this task, you will create a virtual machine to use as a management server.

1. On the Portal menu (top left) select **Create a resource**.

1. Under **Popular**, select **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.

1. Configure the **Basic** information. Take the default value for any setting that is not specified. 

	- Resource group: **AZ500LAB07**

	- Virtual machine name: **myVMMgmt**
	
	- Region: **East US**

	- User: **localadmin**

	- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

	- Public Inbound ports: **None** - We will rely on our NSG rules. 

1. Move to the **Networking** tab (top) and verify this information. Take the default value for any setting that is not specified. 

	- Virtual network: **myVirtualNetwork**

	- NIC network security group: **None**

1. Move to the **Management** tab, and ensure **Boot diagnostics** is **Off**.

1. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

1. Wait for both virtual machines to be deployed before continuing. 


#### Task 3:  Associate each virtual machines network interface to it's application security group.

In this task, you will associate each virtual machines network interface with a application security group. The myVMWeb virtual machine interface will be associated to the myAsgWebServers ASG. The myVMMgmt virtual machine interface will be associated to the myAsgMgmtServers ASG. 

1. On the Portal menu (top left) select **Virtual machines**.

1. Ensure both of your virtual machines are **Running**.

1. Select **myVMWeb. 

1. Under **Settings**, select **Networking** and then **Application security groups** tab.

1. Select **Configure the application security groups** and then select **myAsgWebServers**.

1. **Save** your changes. 

1. Return to the **Virtual machines** blade.

1. Select **myVMMgmt**.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Networking** and then **Application security groups** tab.

1. Select **Configure the application security groups** and then select **myAsgMgmtServers**.

1. **Save** your changes. 

### Task 4:  Test the network traffic filters

In this task, you will test the network traffic filters. You should be able to RDP into the myVMMgmnt virtual machine. You should be able to connect from the internet to the myVMWeb virtual machine and view the default IIS web page.  

1. Continue working with the **myVMMgmt** virtual machine.

1. On the **Overview** pane, click **Connect** > **RDP**.

1. Click **Download RDP file** and open the file.

1. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** dialog select **Connect**.

1. Select **More choices** and then **Use a different account**.

	- Email address: **localadmin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. Click **OK** and click **Yes** to verify the identity of the virtual machine. 

1. Wait for the remote session to open. 

	> The connection succeeds because port 3389 is allowed inbound from the internet to the *myAsgMgmtServers* application security group. The **myVMMgmt** network interface is associate with ASG. 

1. Within the remote session, wait for the **Server Manager Dashboard** to display.

1. Select the **Tools** menu (top right) and then **Windows PowerShell**.
 
1. You now need to connect to the **myVMWeb** virtual machine. This is necessary to install the Web Server feature on that machine. Remember you do not have the ability to RDP into **myVMWeb**. 

1. Connect to **myVMWeb** with command. The command will open a **Enter your credentials** dialog box.

    ```
    mstsc /v:myVmWeb
    ```

	> You are able to connect to the myVmWeb VM from the myVmMgmt VM because VMs in the same virtual network can communicate with each other over any port, by default. You can't, however, create a remote desktop connection to the *myVmWeb* VM from the internet because the security rule for the *myAsgWebServers* doesn't allow port 3389 inbound from the internet, and inbound traffic from the Internet is, by default, denied to all resources.

1. Use the **Enter your credentials** dialog box to login to **myVMWeb**. 

	- Email address: **localadmin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. Click **OK** to connect.

1. The myVMWeb virtual machine will be used as a web server. To install Microsoft IIS you will need to open a PowerShell session.

1. From the **Server Manager Dashboard**, select the **Tools** menu (top right) and then **Windows PowerShell**.

1. Install IIS on the **myVmWeb** VM. This will take a couple of minutes to complete.

    ```
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
    ```

1.  Disconnect your remote sessions.

	> At this point you have confirmed you can RDP into myVMMgmt and you have installed the Web Server feature on myVMWeb. Now, you will check to ensure myVMWeb can be accessed as a web server.

1. In the Portal, navigate to the **Overview** blade of myVMWeb.

1. Copy the Public IP address to the clipboard (icon on the right of the address). 

1. Open an internet browser and browse to `http://<public-ip-address-from-previous-step>`. 

	> The default IIS welcome page should display because port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet to the **myAsgWebServers** application security group. The myVMWeb network interface is associated with that application security group. 

> Result: You have validated that the NSG and ASG configuration is working and traffic is being correctly managed. 


**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. Access the Cloud Shell.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. Remove the resource group using the Cloud Shell and PowerShell.

    ```
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB07"
    ```
