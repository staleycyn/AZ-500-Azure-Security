# Lab 05 - Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept with Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time administration and control the number of users who can perform privileged operations. The specific requirements are:

- User aaduser2 should have a permanent assignment to the Security Administrator role. 
- User aaduser2 should be eligible for the Billing Administrator and Global Reader roles.
- The Global Reader role must require approval from aaduser3 to activate the role.
- Configure an Access Review for the Global Reader role and review auditing capabilities.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East (US)** region. Verify with your instructor this is region to use for you class. 

> Before proceeding ensure you have completed Lab 04: MFA, Conditional Acccess and AAD Identity Protection . You will need both the tenant, AdatumLab500-04, and the aaduser1, aaduser2, and aaduser3 user accounts.
